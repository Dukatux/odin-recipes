    <img src="../images/spaghetti.jpg" height="100px" width="auto" alt="" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a traditional, quick, and simple Neapolitan dish that focuses on
      the quality of the olive oil and garlic.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti (about 8 oz / 225g)</li>
      <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)</li>
      <li>Garlic (4-6 cloves), thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Red pepper flakes (Peperoncino) (to taste)</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley, chopped</li>
      <li>Salt (for the pasta water)</li>
      <li>Optional: Grated Parmesan cheese (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the
        spaghetti and cook until al dente (firm to the bite). Before draining,
        reserve about 1 cup of the starchy pasta water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Infuse the Oil: While the pasta cooks, heat the EVOO in a large skillet
        over low heat. Add the thinly sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Sauté
        the garlic slowly until it is fragrant and lightly golden (do not let it
        burn, or it will taste bitter).
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine: Add the drained spaghetti directly into the skillet with the
        oil and garlic. Toss well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Emulsify: Add a splash or two of the reserved pasta water to the
        skillet. Toss rapidly; the starch in the water will help the oil and
        water emulsify, creating a light, shiny sauce that clings to the pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finish: Stir in the chopped fresh parsley. Serve immediately, topped
        with optional Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
    </ol>
